### Summary

This was a project I did during my Masters of Software Development.   
This project is a basic web browser created in javafx.

### Disclaimer

The project was made early into the degree and hasn't been worked on since.

### Running Notes

Need to delete default build file when starting new javafx project.

Need to remove default javafx from build path. Need to add the proper javafx to module path in build path.

Need to add run configuration VM argument --module-path ||Insert path to javafx lib here||

Would recommend to increase the ram of the VM by using -Xmx4096m
