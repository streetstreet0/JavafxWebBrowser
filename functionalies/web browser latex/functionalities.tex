Tabs can be deleted by mouse wheel clicking on the “Temp” button for that tab. Internally, the current tab is stored in an object called a TabStorer which allows for the current tab to be updated and for every functionality to “see” this update. If there is only one tab and this tab is deleted, a new tab will be created to replace the deleted one. New tabs start on the homepage, which is duckduckgo by default. \par

	\LARGE \noindent \justifying \textbf{Navigation bar:} \par
	\noindent \includegraphics[width=80mm]{images/url.png} \par
	\normalsize \noindent By typing a string into the url bar then pressing enter (in the same way you would for a normal brower) you can load a webpage. If the string starts with “http”, or “www.” then it will be loaded as a url, otherwise it will be loaded as a search using duckduckgo. Url strings are edited to they always start with https:/ (if it starts with http:, https:, or http:/ then that gets replaced. If it starts with www. Then https:/ gets added to the start.). Any special characters in search strings get encoded, so they can become part of the search url.
	Note: if the user types “!@\#\$\%\textsuperscript{$\wedge$}\&*()” into the search bar (excludes the quotation marks), then they will get redirected to twitter.com. This is a feature of duckduckgo search. \par

The settings alert also has a zoom in (+ symbol) button and zoom out (- symbol) button that allows the user to zoom in and zoom out. The current zoom (in \%) is also displayed as text between these buttons. The zoom is the same for all tabs (including newly created tabs). The values for the zoom range between 30\% and 500\%, these values are the same as the zoom values for firefox. If the user tries to zoom out when the zoom is at 30\% or tries to zoom in when the zoom is at 500\%, nothing will happen. \par
	 
	 
	 \LARGE \noindent \justifying \textbf{Load History} \par

	 \noindent \includegraphics[height=20mm]{images/historyAlert.png} \par
	 \normalsize \noindent By clicking on the load history button (see selected). You can load a webpage save in the history into the current tab. Clicking on the load history button loads the load history alert which has a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a url to load. If the user then clicks ok with a url selected, then that url will be loaded. If the user clicks cancel or does not select a url then nothing will happen. \par
	 
	 
	 \LARGE \noindent \justifying \textbf{History} \par
	 \normalsize \noindent The history itself is a ModifiableObservableList that holds HistoryItem objects. Each tab has a WebHistory with a listener that will add new HistoryItems whenever they change webpage. These listeners also change the url in the navigation bar to the url of that webpage.
	 HistoryItem objects hold two fields: historyEntry (a WebHistory.Entry object) and its url. The HistoryItem class was created so I could change the toString method so the load history combo box would look nicer. Note: there is an issue with the date of a WebHistory.Entry object where its Date field would be null and this field is used in HistoryItem’s toString method. To avoid this issue the date used will be the current time. \par
